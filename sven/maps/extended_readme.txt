Well Well Well, another map by me. This'll be the third time I've done this now, and with mixed feelings. The thing about making maps (that so many of the non-english speaking newbie "fans" who add me to their MSN contact lists so hopelessly fail to realise), is that it takes so damm long. Not necessarilly because of the size of the task in hand, but more often because of the lack of any will or time to actually sit down and do it.

This happened quite a lot when making extended (due mostly to an increasingly stressfull AS-Level exam and courcework load), resulting in a end product that took over six months to make, but was probably actually constructed in just a few weeks of build. However, it's always worth it in the end I guess, although here is where I mention that due to its increased and excessive detail, this map is not as long as extension, nor does it include a long, repetitive buggy train ride. But meh, I like it, and I'm sure all you non-english types will continue to add me on MSN regardless to tell me how much they like "si gmanstowers!". Have fun!

Story
==========
This map is essentially a continuation of the "objective" listed in extension, so there's not much to say here, aside from the obligatory copy-and-paste-from-the-MOTD thing...

- - - - - -

TIME: Lambda Incident + 16 hours

In a bid to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility and counter the alien threat, former co-workers of the Facility must work together if they want to stay alive. Survival is only an option to those prepared to put aside their differences and fight as one.

After much bravery and combat, you and your team of Co-Workers have finally managed to evade your Military pursuit and have arrived, hours later, on the outskirts of the Lambda reactor complex. Your goal now is to enter the complex via any means necessary and meet up with the Science Team waiting inside. The Alien presence in this area is high, and the military don't want anyone getting in to the complex and using it to escape.

And you thought this day couldn't get any worse...

Also, if you get ever stuck in this map, and I just know some of you are gonna, I recommend randomly hitting your USE key whilst looking at interesting objects on the floor: like trains, buttons, doors, and bits of paper. You'll get the idea.

Architexture stolen from all over the place, but mostly Paul Shuttles wired. And Gonnas will kill me If I don't mention the fence posts.

Anywho, ignore my ramblings, I'm pretty sure you'll all be Enjoying the map, and I'm fairly confident this map is still one of the better ones out there no matter how self loathing I get. Enjoy the map!
