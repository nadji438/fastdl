HOSTAGE 2 by Kenny - Part One

Between them Gordon Freeman and the trigger happy military have managed to destroy most of Black Mesa. With the computers gone the secret of teleportation rests only in the minds of a few scientists being held hostage by the aliens. Intelligence reports have located the aliens hide out in an old underground base.

Your job is to entyer the base and search for the scientists so you can 'rescue' them. Be warned - the military are after the same prize as you.
