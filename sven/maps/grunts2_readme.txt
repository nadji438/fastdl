STORY
=========================================================

Navaro is a Government Research/Storage facility. After the Black Mesa incident and its consequent destruction, followed by the conquering of the Xen Border world, the US Government set about pulling the remaining Aliens left on Xen through a teleport by force, stunning the creatures and putting them into storage ready for transport to biological research facilities..
 Each creature was tagged to ensure that it stayed asleep and the base was fitted with a Self-Destruct mechanism in case of a escape on a large scale. The self-destruct consists of a nuke wired into a lower part of the base.
 The G-man supported by a large number of well-paid mercenaries has taken over this base. It is believed that the money to pay them off came from a third party. It is unknown how the base fell so quickly but the tags on half of the Aliens were disabled remotely and the creatures are now starting to wake up and are roaming around small sectors of the base
 As part of a elite rapid-action response force, the players will attempt to shut down the defenses controlling the base by transmitting the new security codes to the US recon sattelites. The security which held the bulk of our forces at bay can then be shutdown and access to the main base will become possible.
Hopefully after removing that threat the troops will be able to take care of the bulk of the forces that currently control the base..
 However, it is not expected that this will proceed perfectly and there may be complications when you reach the main base, in this case we will radio you with your further orders. If communication is temporarily lost, it is expected that you will use your training to proceed with the appropriate action.
 We cannot be certain that you will achieve your objectives in time, and it is estimated that the main bulk of the captured aliens will begin to wake up between 30-60 minutes of your entrance into the base perimeter. As most of these specimens are currently on the surface, we cannot risk them escaping as they are considered a Level 4 Biohazard.
 Therefore, we're setting a 30 minute time for you to reach the communications, after you send us the codes we can take remote control of the Alien tags and demobilise all within line of sight of our satellites. However aliens in the base WILL NOT be affected.
 If you do not reach the communications in time, or you and your team is eliminated, we will proceed with low level airstrikes of the base and will eliminate everything within a half-mile radius...

Prefabs used: Elevator Shaft - Andy Marshall - prefabs@auto-line.freeserve.co.uk
	      Large Elevator - Auditu        - auditu@telia.com
	      Rock crusher   - [DRS]Ken_uk   - KEN_UK@excite.com

Note: All used prefabs were _heavily_ altered and were inserted around one and a half years ago. I now have the skill to be able to make these by myself but it would take a large amount of work to replace them. These do the job fine and hey, prefabs are made to be used!

=========================================================
All of this was made by Commando and MaD jOn except where otherwise noted in this readme. Steal it and we will release the dogs! Or the bees! Or dogs with bees in their mouth so that when they bark they shoot bees at you!
