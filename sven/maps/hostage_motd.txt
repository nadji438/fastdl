Four important scientists have been kidnapped by aliens and are being held in a secret
base underneath an abandoned church.

You have to go in and get them before the military boys can do their own brand of "rescue".

Fortunately the aliens have installed a teleport that can be used to get the scientists
out. Lead them into the teleport room and they SHOULD do the rest.
