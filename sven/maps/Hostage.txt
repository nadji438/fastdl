Four important scientists have been kidnapped by aliens and are being held in a secret
base underneath an abandoned church.

You have to go in and get them before the military boys can do their own brand of "rescue".

Fortunately the aliens have installed a teleport that can be used to get the scientists
out. Lead them into the teleport room and they SHOULD do the rest.

*Play Information*

Single Player		: Yes - there is some ammo that only appears in single player HL.

New textures		: Yep - included within the bsp. See note below.
New sounds		: No

Players			: 3-6 recommended

*Construction*

Base			: New level
Editor used		: Worldcraft 2.1 and 3.3 and Gensurf 1.7
Build time              : Much longer than it should have been. I have had a few peoblems...
Known bugs		: There are a couple of VIS leafs problems that mean sometimes some
                          bits can disappear, depending on where they are viewed from. Also,
                          the teleports dont always work on a slow/busy server. Keep the
                          scientists near the teleport and eventually they should go.
                          Finally (what another bug?!) not everyone sees the scoreboard at the
                          end. Strangely its always worked for me.
Compile time            : VIS - 1hr 23mins
                          RAD - 1 hr 1min without -extra. With -extra it hadnt finished after 20 hrs
                          Vismatrix was 82.0 Megs

Notes :
Half way through making this level I had a PCI slot fail, then my PS2 port stopped working and
I have had a couple of complete formats and reinstalls of my HDisk. There are 3 new textures in
the bsp and unfortunately I have lost track of where I got them from. If anyone knows please
contact me and I will give you credit.

Thanks to Nobby for letting me use his server for a bit of multi-player testing.

=========================================================================================

You MAY use this level to make new levels. Infact you can do anything you want with it, just
remember to give credit if its due.

If you want the source please email me at biggles@mindless.com  - it is in WC3.3 RMF format
or .map format.
