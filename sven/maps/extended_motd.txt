Extended Resistance
=========

TIME: Lambda Incident + 16 hours

In a bid to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility and counter the alien threat, former co-workers of the Facility must work together if they want to stay alive. Survival is only an option to those prepared to put aside their differences and fight as one.

After much bravery and combat, you and your team of Co-Workers have finally managed to evade your Military pursuit and have arrived, hours later, on the outskirts of the Lambda reactor complex. Your goal now is to enter the complex via any means necessary and meet up with the Science Team waiting inside. The Alien presence in this area is high, and the military don't want anyone getting in to the complex and using it to escape.

And you thought this day couldn't get any worse...
