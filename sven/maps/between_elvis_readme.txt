 DESCRIPTION
================================================================
For 3-6 players

Black Mesa
2 Days after the dimensional Breach

You and a team of scientists and security personnel are holed up in a portion of the Black Mesa Complex, trying to make a last stand against the onrushing hordes of Xen Creatures as well as the black ops troopers trying to clean everything up.

As well as the hordes of hostiles you will face you may meet other security personnel who will give you a hand, and maybe some scientists who can give you access to more weaponry (if you can keep them alive)

Your task is to hold out and try and survive the onslaught, until help can arrive.


-- This map is a basic defense mission, you must hold off the enemies until rescue can arrive, as time goes by allies may appear. Keeping your allies alive will aid you in various ways, the security guards lend you additional firepower and the scientists can open the weapons crates to improve your arsenal.

Play tips

Firstly don’t play with too few people! this map is designed for 3-6 players, playing with less than 3 will result in your being overrun and killed, lots. Conversely don’t play with too many players and more than 6 and the map becomes too easy and thus boring, If you want to have more than 6 players use the other version of the map Between_Elvis_LG.bsp which is designed for 6+ players

Secondly keep moving round your spawn area, clearing out enemies it’s very easy to neglect one area and allow it to become overrun. If this happens recovering the area will be very difficult.

Thirdly keep your allies alive! all the AI Allies are useful in various ways - guards give you cover fire and scientists can heal you up instantly, as well as unlocking more advanced weapons. Also be sure to keep your teammates health up 2 players working together will last a lot longer and be able to keep a larger area secure than 2 players working independently.
