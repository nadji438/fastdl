Black Mesa
2 Days after the dimensional Breach

You and a team of scientists and security personnel are holed up in a portion of the Black Mesa Complex, trying to make a last stand against the onrushing hordes of Xen Creatures as well as the black ops troopers trying to clean everything up.

As well as the hordes of hostiles you will face you may meet other security personnel who will give you a hand, and maybe some scientists who can give you access to more weaponry (if you can keep them alive)

Your task is to hold out and try and survive the onslaught, until help can arrive.
