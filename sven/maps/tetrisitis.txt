Tetrisitis - A HL2D Map - By Hotdog

Pronounced: Tet-ris-I-tis

This is probably the first HL2D map EVER! A simple idea in the forums inspired this creation. This map was whipped up in about 2 hours and may take you longer to win than it took to make. The goal is simple. Manouver above, below and around the falling Tetris blocks without being squished into paste and climb your way to the chute on the left hand side of the screen. Double Jump is enabled so you can easily make large leaps out of harms way and climb those massive blocks. Keep in mind you can only jump as high as two squares and won't get up a three block wall. There also a jazzy soundrack but if it gets too much for you remember you can disable music from the command menu.

You are WARNED!!! This level is F#*!ING HARD!! Took me 50 tries before I beat it so it will be harder for you. A simple solution for frustration is: "Take a break". Trust me, it helps to keep your cool. Don't say make it easier because otherwise it is too easy.

There are no bugs that I am aware of. Yes, I didn't do a lighting compile because it was rather pointless, makes it look more like the old Tetris game and bricks are easier to see. Unexpectantly, the game does get progressivly harder, as you climb up the ceiling gets closer giving you less warning of incoming bricks. I have positioned the camera further away for ease of brick navigation.
