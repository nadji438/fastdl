TROUBLESHOOTING
This mod is designed only for the current Steam version of Half-Life on Windows.

Ensure that you run the game using the "Half-Life: Echoes" game library shortcut in Steam.
This increases the entity limit and avoids the crash "ED_ALLOC: NO FREE EDICTS"
Do not load Half-Life and change to Echoes from within the custom game menu.

Report any issues that cannot be fixed by the above to the moddb page.

Enjoy, and thank you for playing.
